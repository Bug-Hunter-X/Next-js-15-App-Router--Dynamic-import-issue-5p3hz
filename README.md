# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Import Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using dynamic imports within a component in the Next.js 15 App Router.  The issue is related to how dynamic imports are handled and the timing of component rendering within the new architecture.

## Bug Description

The core problem is that dynamic imports sometimes fail to resolve correctly, leading to rendering issues or unexpected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the application. You should notice that some dynamic imports do not work.

## Expected Behavior

Dynamic imports should resolve and render the imported components correctly and consistently, without errors.

## Actual Behavior

Dynamic imports may fail to resolve, causing rendering errors, or the expected content may not be rendered.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `Suspense` component provided by React to handle asynchronous operations. This allows the component to gracefully handle the loading state while awaiting the result of the dynamic import.
